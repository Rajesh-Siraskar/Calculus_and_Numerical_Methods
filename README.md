# Calculus and Numerical Methods for solving ODE (ordinary differential equations) and PDE (partial differential equations)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Euler's - standard and improved methods
2. Runge Kutta - 2nd and 4th order methods
3. Higher order ODEs
4. Newton's Forward and Backward Difference method for interpolation
